# Website Experiments
Just playing around with what I can do with web languages.

## Parallax and Shapes
Implemented parallax scrolling as well as put text in responsive CSS-only circle- and triangle-shaped divs. Parallax scrolling and shapes resize appropriately in Chrome. Circle does not keep 1:1 ratio in Firefox and MS Edge. Parallax scrolling does not work in Firefox and Edge.
